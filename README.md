This script makes it easier for you to download hackthebox retired machines writeups, so that you can locally have all the writeups when ever you need them.

For me downloading each writeup for more than 100+ machines was a pain, so i created this small and simple script.

This script is completely legal, and need the vip access on your HTB profile.

Requirements:- 

chromium browser

 `the files will be saved automatically to your default browser download location.`

just run the script and relax till, it downloads your writeups.

Steps to run the script:-
``` 
   chmod +x download.sh
 
  ./download.sh
```

-------Before executing script make sure you open hackthebox in firefox web browser and login into your account which has vip access------
